## Experience
### Senior Software Engineer, Quicken Loans
#### November 2019 - June 2022
* System Design
  * For prioritizing service virtualization: Created a roadmap, and architecture design diagram, worked with stakeholders to create a feature estimation with the Weighted Shortest Job First scale and created the features and stories with well-defined acceptance criteria.
  * Created a TypeScript & Mountebank application of virtualized services, using ECR, ECS, and EKS to represent service dependencies of the Rocket Mortgage Origination frontend. 
    * For request logging with Mountebank, the virtualized services integrated with a TypeScript Lambda, behind APIGateway with a defined OpenAPI contract, that accepts Mountebank requests and logs them to an S3 bucket.
    * Created a TypeScript CLI to autogenerate the boilerplate infrastructure, boilerplate TypeScript application for each virtualized service, and CircleCI config updates.
    * Thoroughly documented with many examples covering the why of the application, how to set up new virtualized services, updating existing virtualized services, and infrastructure overview. 
* CI/CD Improvements
  * Created a Composer package called code-quality-tools that was a collection of the Rocket Mortgage Origination CI/CD scripts, to be reusable among all Rocket Mortgage Origination CI/CD pipelines. Thoroughly documented readme that provided examples of how to use each script and provided a commonly used template for a collection of composer.json scripts that mapped to the CI/CD script and made it easy to run things locally as well as in the pipelines.
  * Created a merge freeze continuous integration script written in TypeScript that automated blocking pull requests from being merged during a merge freeze.
  * Created a detailed plan to remove the merge freeze requirement and never block merges but instead block automatic deploys during the deployment window. 
    * Created thorough documentation for use of the CI/CD script including multiple logic flow diagrams to describe exactly what was happening on run.
  * Created a Node CLI to autogenerate a Postman collection, including pre-request OAuth script, using an OpenAPI contract. To be run as a CircleCI job.
  * Created CircleCI merge workflow jobs to automatically build docker images and push them to internal Artifactory to speed up local development with prebuild images.
  * Reduced the time it took to run CI unit test and generate code coverage by 60%.
* Development LifeCycle Improvements
  * Reduced the number of manual steps needed and reduced OS compatibility issues during setup and build for multiple repositories by managing everything through containers.
  * Setup remote debugging for various repository containers using Xdebug, special docker DNS, and Remote Explorer for Visual Studio Code, and added thorough step-by-step documentation on debugging setup.
* Technology Standards
  * Created a CI/CD standard for Rocket Mortgage Origination frontend repositories including
    * pipeline requirements for unit tests, acceptance tests, e2e tests, mutation tests, performance tests, load tests, SCSS linters, Typescript linters, static analysis, unit test coverage, deploy ability checks, and health checks 
    * pipeline optimizations for automatically generating a release at scheduled times and linting commits
    * diagramed continuous integration and continuous delivery ideal workflows for pull requests, merged code, release tag, and scheduled quality checks
  * Created a security risk mitigation standard for Rocket Mortgage Origination frontend, which included
    * existing Rocket Mortgage InfoSec standards that must be followed
    * tools that must be used to mitigate risk including SonarQube, Snyk, CodeQL, docker-file-image-update, npm-check-update, Helmet, and csurf
    * tools that should be used to mitigate risk including cors and a tool for dynamic application security testing
* Mentoring
  * Mentored junior software engineers on using the development environment of the Rocket Mortgage Origination codebases, object-oriented programming concepts, and design patterns used by the codebases.
  * Answered technical questions, offered to pair program with software engineers to share knowledge, and helped prepare junior software engineers for promotional interviews.


### Software Engineer, Quicken Loans
#### June 2017 - November 2019
* Development LifeCycle Improvements
  * Helped develop, document, and diagram a new standard for the development process, including branching strategy, automated deployment to lower environments, and pull request code quality requirements.
  * Created a TypeScript CLI that prompts the user to associate the quality gate scripts with a user-selected Git Hook (e.g. pre-push).
  * Updated the frontend build step to run tasks in parallel and make all the functions asynchronous.
  * Implemented code splitting to lazy load modules with dynamic imports via Webpack.
  * Updated docker images to LTS versions.
  * Added a cache-buster for the assets to benefit the clients.
* Application Design 
  * Created a multistep online schedule closing experience BFF API and view modules for Rocket Mortgage Origination clients to close loans faster. 
  * Built out a co-branded origination experience BFF API and view modules for the clients of Rocket Mortgage Origination partners. 
  * Created a containerized JavaScript application of virtualized services representing all the dependencies of the Rocket Mortgage Origination frontend application, to speed up development and make the acceptance test more reliable.
* Mentoring
  * Mentored junior software engineers on using the development environment of the Rocket Mortgage Origination codebases, object-oriented programming concepts, and design patterns used by the codebases.
  * Advised the Rocket Mortgage Origination backend team on a plan to transition TFS version control to Git version control, which included transferring commits, branching strategy, Git commands, and merging strategy & code quality checks.


### UI Developer, Quicken Loans
#### August 2014 - June 2017
* Fully Redesign the One Reverse Mortgage frontend
  * Collaborated with the design team to create a One Reverse Mortgage style guide for all the one reverse mortgage products both internal and external.
  * Worked with the design team to fix designs that I considered overly complex UI for the web. Thoroughly encouraged a mobile-first design flow. Pushed back on designs that were bad UX with accessibility in mind.
  * Replaced all image graphics with SVG for scaling consistency. Implement SVG animations with SnapSVG for things like taking a base SVG of the United States map and providing tooltip functionality with information about lending for each state.
  * Implemented BEM ideology for all SCSS.
  * Added better client-side validation and maintained regular expression simplicity through concatenating separate reusable regex variables, for things like year, month, date, phone number, etc.
  * Created a basic auth app for MyORM using express and a JWT package.
  * Fully documented application redesign for things like, installation, running the application, debugging, building, unit testing, writing client-side validation, etc.
* Optimized frontend build process
  * Replaced Browserify with Webpack, using a default Webpack file and multiple environment files that import the default file.
  * Added postcss step for Autoprefixer for browser prefixes and purifyCSS to decrease CSS file size by a few percent, by removing unused classes.
  * Added shrinkwrap to the project to ensure package version consistency across installs, before package-lock was available.
  * Created separate modules for each gulp task and updated all the tasks to use ECMAScript 2015.
* Optimized continuous integration quality by setting a standard to require JavaScript unit tests using Mocha.
* Mentored UI developer interns and junior software engineers
  * Taught them CSS/SCSS best practices and methodologies (e.g. BEM, ITCSS, Atomic CSS), ECMAScript 2015 features, semantic HTML, and some standards from WCAG 2.0.
  * Provided thorough explanations for any suggestions I might have had in reviewing their code.
  * Provided opportunities as needed to pair program.
* Contributed to JavaScript Standards Group
  * Helped create standards for things like client-side frameworks and associated technologies, linting, and BFF layer technologies.
